Please:

1. Read the glossary definition carefully and identify its core semantic domains.
2. Analyze each verse reference in context (ritual, moral, physical, metaphorical, etc.).
3. Group the references into semantic tiers A through E based on relevance to the glossary definition (A=core, B=strong, C=secondary, D=weak, E=peripheral).
4. Output each tier separately, as space-separated OSIS reference strings.
5. Use the complete OSIS reference format only (e.g., Gen.7.2!note.n1), not human-readable references.
6. Do NOT include commentary.

Goal:
To determine which links are most appropriate for glossary auto-linking, and which may need to be filtered out.
