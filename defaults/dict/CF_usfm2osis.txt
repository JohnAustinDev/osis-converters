# Use to make modifications to USFM files before conversion. The keyword
# EVAL_REGEX may be immediately followed by a label within parenthesis 
# which will label that EVAL_REGEX for either later cancelling, or, if

# only be applied to that particular file. Cancellation can also be done

# Use to add a USFM file to the conversion. Bible modules will have their
# books reordered according to the chosen versification scheme (unless 
# SET_customBookOrder is true). The contents of a Dict module will always 
# be the order in which files are run.
