# EVAL_REGEX may be immediately followed by a label within parenthesis 
# which will label that EVAL_REGEX for either later cancelling, or, if 
# the label is the path to a particular USFM file then the regex will 
# only be applied to that particular file. Cancellation can also be done 
# by "EVAL_REGEX(label):"
