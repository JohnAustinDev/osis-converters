# This command file is used only when one project is to be built from
# another project's OSIS file (such as when there are multiple scripts 
# for a translation).

# Provide the source project
SET_sourceProject:SRCPRJ

# Typically these don't need to be run again, so turn them off:
SET_addScripRefLinks:false
SET_addFootnoteLinks:false
SET_addDictLinks:false
SET_addCrossRefs:false

# Select a conversion method. Enable one of the following methods:
# 1) A custom script to include which contains the convertString()
# subroutine which is used to convert each string.
SET_MODE_Sub:./<include-name>.pl
# 2) A cc-table to read which will be used to convert each string.
#SET_MODE_CCTable:./<cc-table>
# 3) A custom script to call on each CC:file and CCOSIS:file that follows. 
# When this method is used, commands such as CONFIG_<entry> etc. have no
# effect, since the custom script is expected to handle everything.
#SET_MODE_Script:./<script-name>.pl
# 4) Do no conversion, just copy the file
#SET_MODE_Copy:true

# SET_CONFIG_<entry> commands are used to write entries in config.conf files
SET_CONFIG_Lang=<lang-script>
#SET_CONFIG_KeySort=AaBbCcDdEe...

# SET_CONFIG_CONVERT_<entry> commands are used to convert other entries in 
# config.conf files. By default, only the following entries are converted: 
# (Abbreviation|About|Description|CopyrightHolder_<lang-base>)
#SET_CONFIG_CONVERT_ShortPromo:true

# Some strings should not be converted, and should be skipped this way:
SET_SKIP_STRINGS_MATCHING:(www\.myurl\.com|ISBN)

# Some text nodes should not be converted, and should be skipped this way:
SET_SKIP_NODES_MATCHING:(www\.myurl\.com|ISBN)

# CC:file commands run the chosen conversion method selected previously
# on sourceProject files to obtain converted versions of the files.
CC:./config.conf
CC:./eBook/convert.txt
CC:./html/convert.txt
CC:./GoBible/collections.txt

# This command causes the OSIS file to be converted using the conversion
# method selected previously. With the 'sourceProject' argument, the 
# sourceProject OSIS file will be located and converted, otherwise a 
# path to the OSIS file can be supplied.
CCOSIS:(<path>|'sourceProject')
