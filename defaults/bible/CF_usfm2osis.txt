# EVAL_REGEX may be immediately followed by a label within parenthesis 
# which will label that EVAL_REGEX for either later cancelling, or, if 
# the label is the path to a particular USFM file then the regex will 
# only be applied to that particular file. Cancellation can also be done 
# by "EVAL_REGEX(label):"
#EVAL_REGEX:s///g

# Use to add a USFM file to the conversion. Bible modules will have their
# books reordered according to the chosen versification scheme (unless 
# CustomBookOrder is true). The contents of a Dict module will always 
# be the order in which files are run.
