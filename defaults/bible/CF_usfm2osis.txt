# Use with CF_osis2osis.txt to provide the source module whose OSIS file

# Use when one conversion should start another upon completion. This will 
# chain multiple projects together so that sfm2all.pl converts them each 
# in sequence. This is used when producing multiple modules with 
# different scripts.

# Setting to true allows the book order to remain in the order they are

# Use to make modifications to USFM files before conversion. The keyword
# EVAL_REGEX may be immediately followed by a label within parenthesis 
# which will label that EVAL_REGEX for either later cancelling, or, if 
# the label is the path to a particular USFM file then the regex will 
# only be applied to that particular file. Cancellation can also be done 
# by "EVAL_REGEX(label):"

# Use to add a USFM file to the conversion. Bible modules will have their
# books reordered according to the chosen versification scheme (unless 
# SET_customBookOrder is true). The contents of a Dict module will always 
# be the order in which files are run.
