OSIS-CONVERTERS VERSIFICATION MAPPING:
The goal is to fit any text into a fixed versification system so that each 
verse's number can be identified in both the target and the original verse
system. To make this as easy as possible, only differences between the
source and target verse systems are specified (default is unity).

VSYS_EXTRA:BK.1.2.3
Specifies that this translation inserts this range of extra text. This text
will all be appended to the preceeding extant verse in the verse system.  
The additional verses, and any regular verses following them in the chapter, 
will have alternate verse numbers appended before them, which display 
their number from the source verse system. Likewise, if the range is an
entire chapter, an alternate chapter number will be displayed before the
chapter itself and any following chapters in the book.

VSYS_MISSING:BK.1.2.3
Specifies that this translation does not include this range of text. The 
preceeding extant verse id will be modified to span the missing range, 
but in no case exceeding the end of a chapter, and alternate numbers 
will be appended to any following verses in the chapter. If the range is
an entire chapter, then an empty chapter is inserted, and alternate
chapters are displayed for any following chapters (this is necessary for 
correct mapping to be maintained).

VSYS_MOVE:BK.1.2.3 -> BK.1.2.3
Specifies that this translation has moved the text that would be found 
in range A of the target verse system to range B (ranges A and B must be
the same size). It is processed as a VSYS_MISSING:A followed by a 
VSYS_ADDITIONAL:B.

SET_customBookOrder:true
Turns off the toVersificationBookOrder.pl book re-ordering step (maybe 
rename this script?) and support adding bookGroup divs around existing 
book order.

NOTES:
- Each instruction is evaluated in the order it appears in the CF file, so
any verse in the verse system may be effected by multiple instructions.
- Verse ranges are in the form OSISBK.chapterNum.verseNum.lastVerseNum
where lastVerseNum and verseNum are optional. This means up to an entire
chapter may be specified by a single range.
- This implementation does not accomodate extra books, or ranges of chapters.



EXAMPLE:
Source     Target
1-10       1-20

VSYS_MISSING:BK.1.5.14
1. As is
2. As is
3. As is
4-14. As is (verse 4)
15-20 Here with 5-10 as alternate verse numbers
