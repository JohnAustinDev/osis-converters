# This script converts SFM, control, and OSIS files from one project 
# into those of another. It runs a CF_osis2osis.txt command-file twice 
# in succession. The first pass (preinit) applies any 'CC' instructions,
# which convert control files from the SourceProject into those of 
# the current project. This pass may also create or update the current
# project's config.conf file. During the second pass (postinit), using 
# the new config.conf, any 'CCOSIS' instructions are applied to convert 
# the SourceProject's OSIS file(s) into those of the current project.
# Finally reprocessOSIS() will be run to perform any required
# osis-converters additions/processing to the resulting OSIS file and 
# to validate it.
#
# NOTE: CF_osis2osis.txt may contain instructions for both MAINMOD and 
# DICTMOD, but 'CCOSIS' will only generate an osis file for the module 
# upon which this script is called.
#
# OVERVIEW of CF_osis2osis.txt commands:
#
# CC:<control-file>
# Converts control files using one of the MODEs below.
#
# CCOSIS:<osis-file>
# Converts OSIS files using one of the MODEs below.
#
# MODE_Transcode|MODE_CCTable|MODE_Script|MODE_Copy:
# Available methods of converting files.
#
# In addition to the methods above, these features may also be useful 
# for certain conversions:
#
# bootstrap.pl
# When found in the project directory, it will be run first, even before
# the preinit of CF_osis2osis.txt. This script takes no arguments and 
# can do anything you want.
#
# preprocess.pl and/or preprocess.xsl
# If one or both of these scripts are present in the module directory,
# they will be run on the OSIS file after the 'CCOSIS' instructions but 
# before final processing.
#
# postprocess.pl and/or postprocess.xsl
# If one or both of these scripts are present in the module directory,
# they will be run on the osis file after all processing, just before 
# validation and checking.
#
# There may not be a 'CCOSIS' instruction for a module's OSIS file in 
# CF_osis2osis.txt. In this case, sfm2osis must be run on the 
# module after osis2osis to create its OSIS file. This is useful when 
# osis2osis is only needed to convert SFM and/or control files.
