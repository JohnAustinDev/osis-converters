# This script converts SFM, control, and OSIS files from one project 
# into those of another. It runs a CF_osis2osis.txt command-file twice 
# in succession. The first pass (preinit) applies any 'CC' instructions,
# which convert control files from the SourceProject into those of 
# the current project. This pass may also create or update the current
# project's config.conf file. During the second pass (postinit), using 
# the new config.conf, any 'CCOSIS' instructions are applied to convert 
# the SourceProject's OSIS file(s) into those of the current project.
# Finally reprocessOSIS() will be run to perform any required
# osis-converters additions/processing to the resulting OSIS file and 
# to validate it.
#
# NOTE: CF_osis2osis.txt may contain 'CC' instructions which will create
# control files for both MAINMOD and DICTMOD. These control files will 
# be created/updated anytime osis2osis is called on either the MAINMOD
# or DICTMOD. Similarly 'CCOSIS' can be used to create both MAINMOD and 
# DICTMOD OSIS files. However, only the 'CCOSIS' instruction matching 
# the module on which osis2osis is called will be created. This allows
# 'CCOSIS' to be used on one module, while sfm2osis can be used on the 
# other, if desired.
#
# OVERVIEW of CF_osis2osis.txt commands:
#
# CC:<file>
# Converts control, sfm, image or other module files using one of the 
# MODEs below.
#
# CCOSIS:<osis-file>
# Converts OSIS files using one of the MODEs below.
#
# MODE_Transcode|MODE_CCTable|MODE_Script|MODE_Copy:
# Available methods of converting files.
#
# In addition to the commands above, these features may also be useful 
# for some conversions:
#
# bootstrap.pl
# When found in the project directory, it will be run first, even before
# the preinit of CF_osis2osis.txt. This script takes no arguments and 
# can do anything you want it to.
#
# preprocess.pl and/or preprocess.xsl
# If one or both of these scripts are present in the module directory,
# they will be run on the OSIS file after the 'CCOSIS' instructions but 
# before final processing.
#
# postprocess.pl and/or postprocess.xsl
# If one or both of these scripts are present in the module directory,
# they will be run on the osis file after all processing, just before 
# validation and checking.
