==Comparison of OSIS files to !CrossWire OSIS==
Osis-converters now emulates the markup generated by !CrossWire's [http://www.crosswire.org/svn/sword-tools/trunk/modules/python/ usfm2osis.py]. But additionally the OSIS subType attribute is used to pass optional CSS classes to front-ends. Optional CSS classes supported by xulsword are:
  * x-p-first (for drop-caps)
  * x-text-image (for images embedded in text)
  * x-parallel-passage (for parallel passages cross references)
  * x-ref-cb (for reference title links found in Children's Bibles)


==Comparison of .conf files to !CrossWire .conf==
These scripts also add some xulsword specific .conf file entries:
  * `DictionaryModule=<DictModName>` is used by xulsword to know to look for a companion dictionary.


== A note about cross reference notes ==
  * The `<note type="crossReference">` tags added by [http://code.google.com/p/osis-converters/source/browse/trunk/scripts/addScripRefLinks.pl addScripRefLinks.pl] are inserted from a list of cross references. The cross references in this list have no presentational text, because they are used for many different languages. Although xulsword ignores presentational text within `<note type="crossReference">` tags (auto-generating it based on UI locale instead), some front-ends do rely on it. So the script adds presentational text as follows: `<note type="crossReference" osisRef="Gen.1.1" osisID="Gen.1.1!crossReference.n1"><reference osisRef="Job.38.4-Job.38.7">1,</reference><reference osisRef="Ps.32.6">2,</reference><reference osisRef="Ps.135.5">3</reference></note>`


==Comparison of IMP files to !CrossWire IMP==
  * The IMP Dictionary/Glossary markup is done using OSIS tags. !CrossWire encourages the use of TEI P5 for dictionary markup. Once xulsword and other front-ends fully support TEI, osis-converters may be modified to output TEI dictionaries.


==Deprecated or no longer utilized in osis-converters==
  * Use of `<reference type="x-glosslink">` was used for glossary "see-also" links which point to other glossary terms. With SWORD 1.7s OSISReferenceLinks filter this is no longer necessary and has been dropped.
  * `TabLabel` conf entry was replaced by the standard entry: `Abbreviation`.
  * `GlobalOptionFilter=OSISDictionary` was replaced by the standard `OSISReferenceLinks` filter. 
  * Tags like `<div type="x-Synodal-non-canonical">` are no longer used since non-canonical material is completely left out of all OSIS files to facilitate simpler and quicker runtime detection of v11n coverage.
  * `ReferenceBible=<BibleModName>` was used by xulsword to prefer the listed Bible module when showing Scripture reference previews found in the module. Soon, the reference Bible will be included within each reference's osisRef, like this: `osisRef="MyRefBible:Matt.1.1". So the .conf param `!ReferenceBible` will be unnecessary and is deprecated.
