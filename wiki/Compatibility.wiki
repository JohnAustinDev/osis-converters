==Comparison of OSIS files to !CrossWire OSIS==
There are some differences between the OSIS files generated by the scripts on this site and those generated by the !CrossWire tools. These differences were added to support special features of [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/ xulsword]. These differences should not pose problems for other SWORD compatible programs:

  * Use of the OSIS subType attribute to pass CSS classes through filters. Examples of CSS classes implemented by xulsword are: x-p-first (used to add drop-caps to the first paragraph of some chapters), x-ref-cb (used for special reference titles found in Children's Bibles), x-text-image (used for images which are to be embedded in the text), x-parallel-passage (used for cross references which are parallel passages).

  * Use of `<milestone type="x-p-indent" />` and `<lb />` for paragraphs and poetry indentation. Other front ends (other than xulsword) currently remove the indent tags (which looks fine). !CrossWire generated OSIS files apparently don't utilize `<lb />` tags, but the SWORD back-end handles them correctly. These tags are a rather useful feature because it's not always possible to do an automated conversion from SFM to `<p>...</p>`, `<lg>...</lg>`, and `<l>...</l>` tags. SFM has no closing tags for such constructs, and closing tags cannot always be correctly inferred from context alone. These tags implement paragraphs and poetry formatting using the same milestone approach as SFM, thereby always providing correct formatting conversion. Currently, deeper indents are created by two or three `<milestone type="x-p-indent" />` tags in series.


==Comparison of .conf files to !CrossWire .conf==
These scripts also add some xulsword specific .conf file entries:
  * `ReferenceBible=<BibleModName>` is used by xulsword to prefer the listed Bible module when showing Scripture reference previews found in the module. This way, a particular glossary module is able to automatically show Scripture previews using its companion Bible translation.
  * `DictionaryModule=<DictModName>` is used by xulsword to know to look for a companion dictionary.
  * `GlobalOptionFilter=OSISDictionary` is used to cause the SWORD engine to load xulsword's `<reference type="x-glossary">` link filter.


== A note about cross reference notes ==
  * The `<note type="crossReference">` tags added by [http://code.google.com/p/osis-converters/source/browse/trunk/scripts/addScripRefLinks.pl addScripRefLinks.pl] are inserted from a list of cross references. The cross references in this list have no presentational text, because they are used for many different languages. Although xulsword ignores presentational text within `<note type="crossReference">` tags (auto-generating it based on UI locale instead), some front-ends do rely on it. So the script adds presentational text as follows: `<note type="crossReference" osisRef="Gen.1.1" osisID="Gen.1.1!crossReference.n1"><reference osisRef="Job.38.4-Job.38.7">1,</reference><reference osisRef="Ps.32.6">2,</reference><reference osisRef="Ps.135.5">3</reference></note>`


==Comparison of IMP files to !CrossWire IMP==
  * The IMP Dictionary/Glossary markup is done using OSIS tags. !CrossWire encourages the use of TEI P5 for dictionary markup. Once xulsword and other front-ends fully support TEI, osis-converters may be modified to output TEI dictionaries.


==Deprecated in osis-converters==
  * Use of `<reference type="x-glosslink">` was used for glossary "see-also" links which point to other glossary terms. With SWORD 1.7s OSISReferenceLinks filter this is no longer needed.
  * TabLabel conf entry is replaced by "Abbreviation".
  * GlobalOptionFilter=OSISDictionary is replaced by the OSISReferenceLinks filter. 
  * Use of `<title>` tags with `type="x-intro"` are no longer needed or used.
  * <div type="x-Synodal-non-canonical"> is no longer used since non-canonical material is completely left out of all OSIS files to facilitate simpler and quicker runtime detection of v11n coverage.
