==Comparison of OSIS files to !CrossWire OSIS==
There are currently some differences between the OSIS files generated by the scripts on this site and those generated by the !CrossWire tools. These differences were added to support features of [http://code.google.com/p/xulsword/ xulsword], for which these tools were originally created. These differences should not pose problems for other SWORD compatible programs. Here are the differences I'm aware of:
  * Use of `<reference type="x-glossary">` tags. Xulsword has a special filter which targets these "x-glossary" references to filter them out. Other front ends should display them correctly, but cannot filter them out.

  * Use of `<milestone type="x-p-indent" />` for paragraph and poetry indentation. Other front ends (other than xulsword) currently remove these tags (which looks fine). But this tag is a rather useful feature because it's not always possible to convert from SFM to `<p>...</p>`, `<lg>...</lg>`, and `<l>...</l>` tags. SFM has no closing tags for such constructs, and closing tags cannot always be correctly inferred from context alone. This tag implements indenting using the same milestone approach as SFM, thereby simplifying conversion as well. Currently, deeper indents are created by two or three `<milestone type="x-p-indent" />` tags in series.

  * Use of `<title>` tags with `type="x-intro"`. This attribute setting is used by xulsword to leave introduction titles in place even when Scripture titles are hidden. Other front ends ignore this attribute.

  * The `<note type="crossReference">` tags added by [http://code.google.com/p/osis-converters/source/browse/trunk/scripts/addScripRefLinks.pl addScripRefLinks.pl] are inserted from a list of cross references. The cross references in this list have no presentational text, because they are used for many different languages. Although xulsword ignores presentational text within `<note type="crossReference">` tags (auto-generating it based on UI locale instead), some front-ends do rely on it. So the script adds simple presentational text as follows: `<note type="crossReference" osisRef="Gen.1.1" osisID="Gen.1.1!crossReference.n1"><reference osisRef="Job.38.4-Job.38.7">1,</reference><reference osisRef="Ps.32.6">2,</reference><reference osisRef="Ps.135.5">3</reference></note>`

==Comparison of IMP files to !CrossWire IMP==
  * The IMP Dictionary/Glossary markup is done using OSIS tags. Although !CrossWire encourages the use of TEI P5 for dictionary markup, using OSIS in this case reduces and simplifies the code necessary to handle Scripture references and glossary links.
  * Use of `<reference type="glosslink">` is used for glossary "see-also" links pointing to other glossary terms. Currently, xulsword treats these no differently than any other front-end. But they are not filtered by xulsword's type="glossary" filter (see above).

==Comparison of .conf files to !CrossWire .conf==
These scripts also add some xulsword specific .conf file entries:
  * `ReferenceBible=<BibleModName>` is used by xulsword to prefer the listed Bible module when showing Scripture reference previews found in the module. This way, a particular glossary module is able to automatically show Scripture previews using its companion Bible translation.
  * `DictionaryModule=<DictModName>` is used by xulsword to know to look for a companion dictionary.
  * `GlobalOptionFilter=OSISDictionary` is used to cause the SWORD engine to load xulsword's `<reference type="x-glossary">` link filter.
